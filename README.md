## __Problem Statement__
<div style="text-align: justify">
Global extreme poverty is a pressing issue that affects millions of people worldwide, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating the problem further. According to a report in 2020, an estimated 9.2% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty, a figure that rose from the previous year in 2019 before covid 19 strucks. There are roughly 71 million people that are pushed into extreme poverty since the start of Covid-19 in 2020, and the numbers continues to rise until now. In Malaysia itself, a total of 580, 000 households which were preiously in the M40 category (Income range of RM4850 - 10959 per month) are now fall into the B40 category (Income range < RM4849 per month), which is over half a million of M40 families. While the rise COVID-19 pandemic is reversing the trend of poverty reduction with tens of millions of people in risk of being pushed back into extreme poverty - people are living on less than $1.90/day, causing the first increase in global poverty in more than 20 years.
<br/><br/>
The pandemic has worsened the situation, with economic shutdowns and job losses leading to increased poverty rates, particularly in developing countries. Underserved families are the most affected, with limited access to healthcare, education, and basic necessities like food and shelter. The pandemic has also highlighted the inequalities that exist within societies, as those in marginalized communities are hit the hardest. The effects of COVID-19 on global extreme poverty will be long-lasting, and urgent action is needed to support those affected and prevent further spread.

## __Introducing UpLift__
When you hear the phrase "extreme poverty," what thoughts come to mind? Food, education, jobs, income? Worry not, our app could help in addressesing these factors. Introducing UpLift, a mobile application that assists both the underserved and underpriviledged communities to earn more income by utilising their free time. With this app, not only 1 family member could contribute to the family income, the entire family members could contribute to the household income. 

The app has 3 main features: 
</br>
- Marketplace - Platform that allows the underserved communities to utilise their skills and expertise and sell their handmade food or handcrafted items that they made  such as home decor products like canvas paintings.
- Job portal - Platform that allows the underserved communities to search for more job opportunities 
- Education - Due to the low financial literacy rates among the underserved communities, this platform could educate them on investment, financial planning and etc, letting them know how they can use the income they earned wisely
